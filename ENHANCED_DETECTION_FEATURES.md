# Enhanced Detection Review - Visual Indicators Implementation

## Summary
Enhanced video analysis interface with colorful visual indicators for manual tagging choices:

### Features Added:
1. **Manual Choice Indicators**: Visual feedback for manual corrections vs AI suggestions
2. **Navigation Panel Enhancement**: Color-coded indicators for review status
3. **Resume Analysis Support**: Maintains visual state when resuming from Excel
4. **Multi-State Tracking**: AI accepted, manual corrections, manual labels

### Visual Indicators:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: AI suggestions accepted by user (top choice)
- ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Manual corrections (user chose different AI suggestion, not top choice)  
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: Manual labels (custom input OR choice not in current AI suggestions)
- âšª **Gray**: Unreviewed detections

### Logic Examples:
- **Purple**: User chose "taxi" but AI suggests ["car", "bike"] (resume case)
- **Orange**: AI suggests ["car", "truck"], user picks "truck" (2nd choice)
- **Green**: AI suggests ["car", "truck"], user picks "car" (top choice)

### Files Modified:
- `/src/components/EnhancedDetectionReview.tsx` - Main enhanced component
- `/src/app.tsx` - Updated imports and data handling

### Key Enhancements:
1. **Progress Bar**: Shows breakdown by choice type
2. **Crop Borders**: Color-coded based on choice type
3. **Navigation Grid**: Enhanced indicators with icons
4. **Choice Status**: Real-time feedback in header
5. **Button States**: Visual distinction for selected choices

### Usage:
- During fresh video analysis: Shows manual corrections in real-time
- During resume from Excel: Preserves and displays previous choices
- Navigation panel: Click any detection to jump, see status at a glance

## Technical Implementation:
- Enhanced detection state tracking
- Color-coded UI components  
- **Corrected choice validation logic** (Purple for non-AI choices, Orange for AI re-ranking)
- Visual feedback for all interaction states
- Consistent indicator logic across all UI components
- Resume state preservation with accurate visual indicators
