## 📊 **Sheet 3: Detection Charts**

### **3.1 Vehicle Type Distribution (Pie Chart)**
Shows percentage breakdown of all detected vehicles.

**How to read:**
- Larger slices = more common vehicle types
- Percentages add up to 100%
- Colors help distinguish vehicle types

**Example interpretation:**
```
🚗 Cars (63.2%) - Dominant vehicle type
🏍️ Motorcycles (19.0%) - Secondary traffic
🚴 Bicycles (12.6%) - Moderate bike activity
🚛 Trucks (3.6%) - Light commercial traffic  
🚌 Buses (1.6%) - Minimal public transport
```

### **3.2 AI Confidence Distribution (Histogram)**
Shows how confident the AI was across all detections.

**How to read:**
- X-axis: Confidence levels (0-1 or 0-100%)
- Y-axis: Number of detections
- Peak locations show most common confidence levels

**Example interpretation:**
```
Peak at 85-90%: AI was very confident about most detections
Few detections <50%: AI rarely made uncertain predictions
Long tail 90-100%: Many near-perfect confidence scores
```

### **3.3 Timeline Detection Rate (Line Chart)**
Shows detection activity over video duration.

**How to read:**
- X-axis: Time in video (seconds or MM:SS)
- Y-axis: Number of detections per time window
- Peaks = busy periods, valleys = quiet periods

**Example interpretation:**
```
Peak at 2:30: Traffic jam or busy intersection
Valley at 7:00: Low traffic period
Steady 4-6/minute: Normal traffic flow
```

### **3.4 Vehicle Size Analysis (Scatter Plot)**

00:30-01:00: 18 detections (0.60/second)
01:00-01:30: 8 detections (0.27/second)
...
```

**Calculation method:**
1. Divide video into equal time windows (30 seconds each)
2. Count detections in each window
3. Calculate rate = detections ÷ window duration

**Vehicle Type Timeline**
Shows when different vehicle types appeared:
```
Cars: Consistent throughout video
Motorcycles: Peak during 2:00-4:00
Bicycles: Most active 1:00-2:00 and 5:00-6:00
Trucks: Sporadic, mainly 3:00-4:00
```

### **4.2 Traffic Flow Analysis**

**Direction Analysis**
Based on object movement between frames:
```
Left-to-Right Movement: 142 vehicles (57.5%)
Right-to-Left Movement: 105 vehicles (42.5%)
Net Flow: 37 more vehicles left-to-right
```

**Speed Estimation**
Estimated from object position changes:
```
Average Speed: 24 pixels/frame = ~45 km/h*
Fastest Detection: 67 pixels/frame = ~125 km/h*
Slowest Detection: 3 pixels/frame = ~6 km/h*

*Speed estimates require calibration for accuracy

## 🧮 **Detailed Statistical Calculations**

### **Example 1: AI Accuracy Calculation**

**Sample Data:**
```
Total Detections: 100
AI Predicted "car", Human agreed "car": 67
AI Predicted "car", Human chose "truck": 8  
AI Predicted "motorcycle", Human agreed "motorcycle": 15
AI Predicted "bicycle", Human chose "motorcycle": 3
AI Predicted "truck", Human agreed "truck": 7
```

**Step-by-step calculation:**
```
Correct Predictions = 67 + 15 + 7 = 89
Total Predictions = 100
AI Accuracy = (89 ÷ 100) × 100 = 89.0%
```

### **Example 2: Detection Density Analysis**

**Sample Video:**
- Duration: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- Total Detections: 150

**Calculations:**
```
Overall Density = 150 ÷ 300 = 0.5 detections/second

Per-Minute Analysis:
Minute 1 (0-60s): 45 detections = 0.75/second
Minute 2 (60-120s): 32 detections = 0.53/second  
Minute 3 (120-180s): 28 detections = 0.47/second
Minute 4 (180-240s): 23 detections = 0.38/second
Minute 5 (240-300s): 22 detections = 0.37/second

Peak Period: Minute 1 (0.75/second)
Quiet Period: Minute 5 (0.37/second)
```

### **Example 3: Vehicle Size Analysis**

**Sample Data for Cars:**
```
Detection 1: 145×98 pixels
Detection 2: 132×89 pixels  
Detection 3: 156×105 pixels
Detection 4: 128×87 pixels
Detection 5: 149×96 pixels
```

**Statistical Calculations:**
```
Average Width = (145+132+156+128+149) ÷ 5 = 142.0 pixels
Average Height = (98+89+105+87+96) ÷ 5 = 95.0 pixels

Standard Deviation Width:
1. Differences from mean: [3, -10, 14, -14, 7]
2. Squared differences: [9, 100, 196, 196, 49]
3. Variance = (9+100+196+196+49) ÷ 5 = 110
4. Std Dev = √110 = 10.5 pixels

Typical Car Size: 142±11 × 95±8 pixels
```

## 🆘 **Getting Help with Analysis**

### **Common Questions**

**Q: "My AI accuracy is only 65%. Is this normal?"**
A: This depends on video quality and content. For traffic videos with good lighting, expect 80-90%. Poor weather, night videos, or unusual angles can reduce accuracy.

**Q: "Why are there so few bicycle detections?"**
A: Bicycles are smaller and harder to detect. Check if the confidence threshold is too high, or if bicycles are actually present in the video.

**Q: "The vehicle counts seem too low."**
A: Check the frame skip setting. If processing every 30th frame, you might miss vehicles that appear briefly.

### **Data Validation Checklist**

Before drawing conclusions:
- ✅ Watch sample video segments to verify detection quality
- ✅ Check if AI predictions match your visual assessment  
- ✅ Verify vehicle type classifications make sense
- ✅ Look for systematic biases (e.g., missing small objects)
- ✅ Compare results with manual counts on short segments
